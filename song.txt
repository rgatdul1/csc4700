Exchange by Bryson Tiller
This what happen when I think about you
I get in my feelings, yeah
I start reminiscing, yeah
Next time around, f*ck I want it to be different, yeah
Waiting on a sign, guess it's time for a different prayer
Lord please save her for me
Do this one favor for me
I had to change my player ways
Got way to complicated for me
I hope she's waiting for me
Everywhere she go, they playin' my song
That's why I say the things that I say
That way I know you can't ignore me
But so, so (Yeah)
So gimme all of you in exchange for me
Just give me all of you in exchange for me, for me
Break it down, yeah
Yes sir, check
We used to lay up and then stay up
Have s*x and then blow dank
I shouldn't have played no games with you
Just leveled up my rank
Last time I saw you we ain't speak that was strange
Guess it's nothing I can do, man it's true, exes change, yeah
Guess you changed for the better (Better)
I know you know how to make me jealous
I was never loyal, let you tell it, yo
But I'm ready to fix it if you ready, baby
But so, so (Yeah)
So gimme all of you in exchange for me
Just give me all of you in exchange for me, for me
For real shawty
Yeah, I know
Yeah, is you at Two Keys or Tin Roof?
Turn up with young Tiller, we just getting loose
Maybe, I'm low key feelin' you, don't be cynical
Won't f*ck you over, wanna f*ck you over and again
The truth is I ain't really here to start problems
Girl I swear to God, them h*es can't never say they got him
Know how bad you wanna tell 'em, don't try him
I don't wanna tell him, let's surprise 'em
I don't wanna get into it, why you stressin' him, I've been drivin'
Back and fourth, from Louisville to Lexington, mileage
On the whip, got your ass on my grip, college
Make you wanna strip for them dollars
Nah, girl I got a job for you
Swear to God I can do a lot for you
Saw you strollin' through the campus, I had to stop for you
I was scrollin' through the 'Gram, girl, I had to follow you
Say what's up with you?
You got my soul
